# Density and Phases of Matter

| Abigail Lee | Period 1 | Chemistry |

**The different densities of solids, liquid, and gases can be explained by differences in the arrangements of their particles of matter.**

### Density

The density of most gases is thousands of time smaller than most liquids and solids.

Compared to solids and liquids the particles of a gas are extremely far apart!

## Important

_Density (not weight!) determines if something will sink of float._

- Objects sink in a fluid that is less dense.
- Objects float in a fluid that is more dense.

### Example:
